        A home page, index page, or main page is a page on a website. A Home Page usually refers to:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The initial or main web page of a website, sometimes called the "front page" (by analogy with newspapers).
            </li>
            <li>
                The first page that appears upon opening a web browser program, which is also sometimes called the start page.[1]
                This 'start page' can be a website or it can be a page with various browser functions such as the visual display
                of websites that are often visited in the web browser.
            </li>
            <li>
                The web page or local file that automatically loads when a web browser starts or when the browser's "home" 
                button is pressed; this is also called a "home page". The user can specify the URL of the page to be loaded, 
                or alternatively choose e.g. to re-load the most recent web page browsed.
            </li>
            <li>
                A personal web page, for example at a web hosting service or a university web site, that typically is stored
                in the home directory of the user.
            </li>
            <li>
                In the 1990s the term was also used to refer to a whole web site, particularly a personal web site.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        A home page can also be used outside the context of websites, such as to refer to the principal screen of a user interface,
        which is also referred to as a home screen on mobile devices such as cell phones.
        </p>
    </div>
        
        <div id="content"></div>
